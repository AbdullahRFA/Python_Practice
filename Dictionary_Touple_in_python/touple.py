# This Python code snippet is defining a tuple named `dimension` with three values: 120, 245, and 456. Then, it is unpacking the values of the tuple into three variables `x`, `y`, and `z` respectively. Finally, it is printing out the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` using the `print` function.
dimension=(120,245,456)
x,y,z=dimension

print('x = ',x,'y = ',y,'z = ',z)
