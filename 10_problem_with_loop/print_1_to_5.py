# The code you provided is a Python script that prompts the user to enter a starting number (`n`) and an ending number (`m`). It then iterates through a range of numbers starting from `n` up to and including `m`. For each number in this range, it prints the number followed by a space using the `end=(" ")` parameter in the `print` function.
# This Python code prompts the user to enter a starting number and an ending number. It then iterates through a range of numbers starting from the starting number up to and including the ending number. For each number in this range, it calculates the square of the number using the exponentiation operator `**` and prints the result separated by a space.
for i in range(1,6):
    print(i)
    
    
# print 1 to n
# target_value=int(input("Enter Ending number : "))
# for i in range(1, target_value+1):
#     print(i)
    
# print in between n and m
